# Pika Macro ASsembler

A simple 2-pass assembler with a customizable instruction set.

Please note that this is something of a restoration project. PMAS is not really intended to be the future of PokÃ©mon mini homebrew going forward. Please check out the official [Epson utilities][Epson] or [Skiploom][] instead.

## Executables

* `pmas` - Assembler
* `pmdis` - Disassembler

## Further information

* `cpu/minx` - The original MindX-based instruction set, from back when we called the PM code MinX
* `cpu/s1c88` - The official Epson S1C88 instruction set
* `cpu/pm` - A combination of the above two syntaxes
* `cpu/r16` - Some other instruction set DarkFader left here
* `cpu/*/readme.s` - A quick reference of directives and required syntax

## About

PMAS was originally designed by Rafael Vuijk (DarkFader) of darkfader.net but he's essentially disappeared so now it's maintained by the pokemon-mini.net community.

The final official release version was 0.15 (built) and 0.19 (source).
